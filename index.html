                <h1>Amateur to Expert</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the Amateur to Expert website, where you can follow along as I work to improve my photography and editing skills, steadily progressing one day at a time</p>
                <p>The tips, techniques and blog posts written here are all based of my own opinions and experience gained through trial and error. Since I primarily shoot with my phone, most of the blog posts will cater more to mobile photography, but many of the tips can easily be applied to camera photography as well. To whoever goes through this site, I hope you have as much fun going through it as I had learning it and hopefully you can learn a thing or two from it as well</p>
