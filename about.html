                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hello there! Hopefully you now understand the purpose of this website, but I think it's only fair that I share a bit about me and the circumstances that led me here</p>
                <p>I have been interested in photography and photo editing for many years, alternating between practicing and taking breaks. During university, I began taking more photos, which reignited my interest at a casual level. Over the last year, this interest has continued to grow.</p>
                <p>However, photography is just one of my interests. I have always wanted to learn how to code, so when I saw a course offered to people with no coding experience, I didn't hesitate before signing up. As part of the course, I had to create my own website, so I thought "Why not combine my two interests?" and VOILA this blog was born!</p>
